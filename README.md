![React Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-blue.svg)


#### Description of your project
This project is a replica of the radio from Portal that displays the time in an arch. The code gets the time through an internet connection.

## Getting Started
#### Environnment Preperation
1. Using Arduino IDE Boards Manager \(preferred)\
	*[Instructions for Boards Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)
2. Libraries that are used in the project need to be added through the Library Manager. \(Include Library)\
	*Some of the libraries can be installed through Manage Libraries in the Include Library section under the Sketch tab.
	*The libraries can also be installed using the zip files through Add .ZIP Libraries in the Include Library section under the Sketch tab.
3. The project needs a WiFi connection in order to get the time. The SSID and Password need to be added.
```c++
const char *ssid     = "<SSID>";
const char *password = "<PASSWORD>";
```
4. The project needs the server pool for your region as well as the time from UTC \(Coordinated Universal Time)\
```c++
// You can specify the time server pool and the offset (in seconds, can be
// changed later with setTimeOffset() ). Additionaly you can specify the
// update interval (in milliseconds, can be changed using setUpdateInterval() ).
NTPClient timeClient(ntpUDP, "north-america.pool.ntp.org", -25200, 60000);
```
5. The .STL files can be found here. some modifications need to be made after printing in order to duplicate project.

#### Pull request
Pull requests are always welcome, and I'll do my best to do reviews as fast as I can.

## Get Help
- If appropriate, [open an issue](https://github.com/PixelThe1AndOnly/PortalRadioClock/issues) on GitHub

## Motivation
I have always wanted to make my own alarm clock and I felt that making the alarm clock look like the radio from Portal would be nice. I decided to make it as a present for my brother. I had to scale down my original idea for the sake of time.
